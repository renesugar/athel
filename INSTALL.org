* External Dependencies
** Debian
~apt-get install~
- =elixir= :: current testing distro version of 1.2.6, should be fine (I've been using 1.3.2)
- =npm= :: make sure to run ~ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node~
- =postgres=
- =libmagic=

* Dependency setup
** PostgreSQL
To setup for development or testing:
run ~sudo su postgres -c psql~
followed by ~alter user postgres with password 'postgres';~ in the psql console
** Elixir
- ~mix deps.get~ :: pull in dependencies
- ~mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate~ :: initialize database
** Node.js
Node is only being used as a build system for the (currently non-existent) frontend.
This is optional if you only care about NNTP
- ~npm -g install npm~ :: update npm to the latest version
- ~npm install~ :: pull local dependencies
- ~npm install -g brunch~ :: will put =brunch= into the path, can be skipped by using node_modules/brunch/bin/brunch directly
** TODO emagic
I had to copy the .so to somewhere for testing...

* Running
~mix phoenix.server~ should get you going, the NNTP server will be running on port 8119
~mix test~ to run tests. The error output is expected for a few tests for the time being.

* Deployment
We'll get there...
